# OOP-Project

We are designing and implementing a library management system with the requirements:

 -Design a system that can manage various library resources, including books,
magazines, and DVDs. Each type of item should have unique properties and rules
for borrowing.

 -Implement user management for different types of library members (students,
faculty, public) with varying borrowing privileges and durations.

 -Create functionality to register items, lend them out, accept returns, and track
overdue items, considering the
specific rules for each type of resource and member.
